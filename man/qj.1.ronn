jc(1) -- compile json schema to C++ json parser/serializer
==========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`jc` `--in` <file> `--out` <file>

## DESCRIPTION

`QuantumJson` compiles JSON schema definition into C++ header only library.
The generated file has parsing/serialization logic for structures defined
in the schema file.

More details are given in [SCHEMA LANGUAGE][] and [API][] sections below.

## OPTIONS

  * `--in`:
    Input file name.

  * `--out`:
    Output file name.

## SCHEMA LANGUAGE

Schema language uses `C++` like syntax, which is useful for syntax highlighting
etc.


Following is a valid QuantumJson schema file:

    // JSON object of type Vector3
    struct Point3
    {
        // has 3 attributes named x,y,z of JSON number type
        double x;
        double y;
        double z;
    };

    // JSON object of type Geometry
    struct Geometry
    {
        // has string attribute named obj_name
        string obj_name;

        // has attribute named points which should be a JSON list of Point3
        // objects
        vector< Point3 > points;
    }

Since this is not a C++ code, but rather a schema definition,
`#include` or `using namespace std;` statements are not used.

When compiled, output will contain struct `Point3` and `Geometry` definitions,
along with their parsing/serialization logic. Only the generated header file
is needed to be included.

Following is an example usage:

    std::string input = "<some valid json>";
    Geometry g;
    g.MergeFromJson(input);

    std::cout << g.name << "\n";
    std::cout << g.points[0].x << "\n";

The call will throw an exception if the input JSON is invalid or its structure
is conflicting with the schema definition. Although unknown fields in input
is not considered a conflict and are silently ignored for backwards compatibility.

As an example, the code will be able to parse following JSON:

    {
        "obj_name": "Name1",
        "points": [
            {
                "x": 1.2,
                "y": 2.3,
                "z": 3.4
            },
            {
                "x": 3e10,
                "y": -123.123e77,
                "z": -0
            }
        ]
    }
